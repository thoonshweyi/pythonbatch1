# Iterating Over Key-Value Pairs Using .items()
#    The .items() method returns a view object containing key-value pairs as tuples. 
#    You can unpack these pairs into two variables while iterating.
#    .items() Method in Python
#    The .items() method is a dictionary method that returns a view object. 
#    This view object contains key-value pairs as tuples, which can be iterated over or converted to other data structures.
#    Why Use .items()?
#    Itâ€™s particularly useful when you need to access both keys and values at the same time while iterating through a dictionary.

# Why Iterating Over a Dictionary Only Gets Keys by Default?
# Default Behavior
# When you iterate directly over a dictionary, only the keys are returned by default:

# end: A string to append after the content is printed.
# Default: '\n' (new line).
# Custom: Any string or empty string ("").


# Using enumerate() with list()
# The enumerate() object can be converted into a list of tuples.
# enumerate(paints) automatically pairs each item in the list with its index.
# The index and paint variables unpack the tuple (index, item) returned by enumerate().
