# 1. with open(...) (Context Manager Approach)
#  Advantages of with open(...):
# Automatic Resource Management ‚Äì The file closes automatically after exiting the with block, even if an error occurs.
# No Need for file.close() ‚Äì Python handles closing the file for you.
# Prevents File Corruption ‚Äì If the script crashes before file.close(), this method ensures the file is properly closed.
# üöÄ When to Use with open(...)?
# Recommended for reading, writing, or appending files.
# Useful when handling exceptions automatically.

# 2. Declaring File Variable Manually (file = open(...))
# Disadvantages of Manually Opening Files
# You must close the file manually (file.close()). If you forget, it can cause memory leaks or file corruption.
# If an error occurs before file.close(), the file remains open.
# More lines of code compared to with open(...).
# ‚úî When to Use file = open(...)?
# When you explicitly need to keep the file open for multiple operations.
# If handling files outside a block structure.

# Key Differences Table
# Feature	                         with open(...) (Context Manager)	file = open(...) (Manual)
# Closes file automatically?	     ‚úÖ Yes	                         ‚ùå No (must use file.close())
# Handles exceptions?	          ‚úÖ Yes	                         ‚ùå No
# Prevents memory leaks?	          ‚úÖ Yes	                         ‚ùå No
# Ease of use?	                    ‚úÖ Easy	                         ‚ùå Requires manual handling
# Good for large file handling?	‚úÖ Yes	                         ‚ùå No (risk of open file leak)




# writelines() writes multiple lines at once but does not add \n automatically.
# If you want line breaks, you must include \n manually.
# Use "w" mode to overwrite or "a" mode to append.
# It is faster than multiple write() calls when writing many lines.

# Comparison: write() vs writelines()
# Method	          What it does	                    Adds \n automatically?	Input type
# write()	          Writes a single string to the file	‚ùå No	                    String (str)
# writelines()	     Writes multiple lines at once	     ‚ùå No	                    List of strings (list[str])


# Why Doesn‚Äôt Each write() Overwrite the Previous Line?
# The write() function does not reset the cursor to the beginning of the file each time it runs.
# Instead, it keeps appending sequentially within the same file session.
# üöÄ Key Rule:
# "w" mode only clears the file at the time of opening.
# Subsequent write() calls continue from the last cursor position until the file is closed.
